# MultiFusionNet: Multimodal Learning for Physical Activity Insights

## Introduction
Physical activity monitoring and analysis play a crucial role in understanding individual health and motivation. However, traditional unimodal approaches often fail to capture the complexity and diversity of physical behaviors. This project introduces **MultiFusionNet**, a multimodal learning framework designed to enhance physical activity insights by integrating diverse data modalities.

Our approach leverages:
- **Modality-specific encoders** to capture rich patterns from different data sources.
- **Hierarchical fusion mechanisms** to model interdependencies between modalities.
- **Dynamic Modality Integration (DMI)** to handle incomplete or noisy data dynamically.

This framework overcomes challenges such as modality heterogeneity, temporal misalignment, and missing data, enabling more robust and interpretable analysis of physical activity.

## Features
- **Multimodal Data Fusion**: Integrates multiple data sources for enhanced representation learning.
- **Adaptive Modality Handling**: Dynamically adjusts modality contributions based on data quality and relevance.
- **Robust and Interpretable Insights**: Provides actionable insights for health monitoring and behavior analysis.
- **Scalability**: Supports various physical activity scenarios with flexible model configurations.
